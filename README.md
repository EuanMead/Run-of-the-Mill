#  Run of the Mill

## Changelog:

### v.1.0 : August 25th, 2011

Run of the Mill attempts to provide the 'average joe' with a template which can scale up from one page to a thousand pages. All server related goodies from the original HTML5 Boilerplate have been removed because they do not work often, nor do they work on every server.

### The Engine

The engine is more or less powered by a modified version of Nicolas Gallagher's normalize.css. The modifications make every block element auto clear any float elements without the need to declare classes or extra elements. This works in all major browsers including IE6.

### The Structure

The structure is in essence a light-weight version of HTML5 Boilerplate. The main directory contains a favicon(.ico), humans(.txt) text-file, robots(.txt) text-file and an index.html file.

### Folder Structure

There are js, css and img folders. The img and the js folder are empty however the css folder contains the main stylesheet (style.css).

#### Thanks, Euan
